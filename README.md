*Note: This branch is for research related to the future of Orbit.*

Orbit is a framework to write distributed systems on the JVM. It is particularly suited to soft real-time applications such as online games.
It allows developers to write highly distributed and scalable applications using virtual actors, streams and other concepts.
The framework aims to make writing such applications more straightforward by greatly simplifying clustering, discovery, networking, state management, actor lifetime and more.
